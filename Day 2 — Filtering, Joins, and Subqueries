Concept focus: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOIN, subqueries, IN, EXISTS
Practice:

1. Find customers who never placed an order.
1. select customer_id from customers where customer_id not in (Select distinct customer_id from orders)

2. List products that were never sold.
2. select product_id from products where product_id not in (Select distinct product_id from orders)

3. Get customers who spent more than the average customer spend.
3. select customer_id, sum(amount) from orders group by customer_id 
having sum(amount) > (select avg(amount) from (select sum(amount) as total_Spend from orders  group by customer_id) t
)

4. Retrieve orders that include more than 3 distinct products.
4. select order_id, count(distinct product_id) as cnt from orders group by order_id having count(distinct product_id) > 3

5. Find customers who placed an order in both Jan and Feb 2024.
5. select customer_id from orders where month(order_date)  = 1 and customer_id in (select customer_id from orders where month(order_date)  = 2)
 Another version

SELECT customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-29'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT MONTH(order_date)) = 2;
