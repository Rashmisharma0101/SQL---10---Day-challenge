Concept focus: Handling NULLs, outliers, duplicates, conditional filters
Practice:

1. Columns with NULLs in more than 10% of rows.
1. 

2. Identify duplicate customer records (same name & email).
2. select customer_name, email from customers where customer_id  in (select customer_id from customers
group by customer_id
having count(email) > 1)

3. Detect orders 3× higher than customer’s avg order amount.
3. with cte1 as (select  orders.customer_id, avg(orders.order_amount) as avg_amount from orders
group by orders.customer_id)
select distinct orders.customer_id, orders.order_amount from orders join cte1
on orders.customer_id = cte1.customer_id
group by orders.customer_id
having orders.order_amount > 3*(cte1.avg_amount)


4. Customers placing >5 orders in one day.
4. with cte1 as (select customer_id, orders.order_date, count(order_id) as cnt
from orders
group by customer_id, orders.order_date)
select cte1.customer_id from cte1
having cnt > 5

5. Customers with missing city info but valid orders.
5. with cte1 as (select distinct customer_id from customers where customer_id in (select distinct customer_id from orders))
select customers.customer_id, customers.city from cte1 join customers
on cte1.customer_id - customers.customer_id
where customers.city is null
