Concept focus: Query design thinking + explain plan readiness
Practice / Discussion:

Rewrite a query using CTE instead of subquery.

Explain how you’d optimize a slow query joining 3 tables.

Show same output using window function instead of GROUP BY.

Create a view to store top-performing products.

Simulate an end-to-end question:
“Find top 3 customers by revenue in each month who increased spending vs the previous month.”

💡 Mock interview tip: Be ready to explain your thinking process, not just syntax.
