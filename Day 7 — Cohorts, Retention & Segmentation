Concept focus: Date functions, grouping by derived columns, logic-based segmentation
Practice:

First purchase month for each customer (cohort).

Number of customers who ordered in both Jan & Feb 2024 (retention).

Total orders per cohort month.

Categorize customers into Platinum / Gold / Silver tiers by total spend.

Find churned customers (ordered in 2024 but not in 2025).
💡 Explain: How SQL can be used for retention dashboards.
